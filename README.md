# Sudden-Network-Slowdown
- [Scenario Creation](https://github.com/JordanDanielWest/Exfiltration-of-Company-Data/blob/main/Exfiltration%20of%20Company%20Data%20Event%20Creation.md)

## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Powershell

##  Investigation Scenario: Sudden-Network-Slowdown

The server team has noticed a significant network performance degradation on some of their older devices attached to the network in the 10.0.0.0/16 network. After ruling out external DDoS attacks, the security team suspects something might be going on internally.

### High-Level Network-Related IoC Discovery Plan

- **Check `DeviceNetworkEvents`** for excessive or repeated connection attempts to internal IP ranges (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`), especially targeting a single host.
- **Use `DeviceProcessEvents`** to trace back the origin of processes initiating network activity—especially those spawned by interactive users.
- **Cross-reference timestamps** with login activity in `DeviceLogonEvents` to confirm user context.


---

## Steps Taken

### 1. Searched the `DeviceNetworkEvents` Table

I started by searching for failed connection attempts in DeviceNetworkEvents table and discovered 23 failed connections on endpoint “edr-machine”

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
| summarize FailedConnectionAttempts = count() by DeviceName, ActionType, LocalIP, RemoteIP
| order by FailedConnectionAttempts desc

```

---

### 2. Searched the `DeviceNetworkEvents` Table

I then ran a query in the DeviceNetworkEvents table to look deeper into the connection attempts between “edr-machine” and port “10.0.0.5” and based on the results I believe a port scan was run.


**Query used to locate event:**

```kql

DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "edr-machine"
| where RemoteIP == "10.0.0.5"
| sort by Timestamp desc

```

---

### 3. Searched the `DeviceProcessEvents` Table

I pivoted to the DeviceProcessEvents table and found a powershell execution of portscan.ps1 at Apr 20, 2025 8:12:29 AM.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
let SpecificTime = datetime(2025-04-20T13:12:29.9031119Z);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "edr-machine"
| where Timestamp between ((SpecificTime - 1m) .. (SpecificTime + 1m))
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, FolderPath
| sort by Timestamp asc

```

---

### 4. Search `DeviceProcessEvents` table for instances of powershell

Just prior to the launch of portscan.ps1 from powershell I found a InitiatingProcessparentFilename of userinit.exe which suggests a user initiated powershell session at: Apr 20, 2025 8:12:10 AM.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
// Instances of Powershell
let SpecificTime = datetime(2025-04-20T13:12:29.9031119Z);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "edr-machine"
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where Timestamp between ((SpecificTime - 1m) .. (SpecificTime + 1m))
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, ActionType, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessParentFileName, LogonId
| sort by Timestamp asc

```

---

### 5. Search `DeviceLogonEvents` table

I then pivoted to the DeviceLogonEvents table and found that the user account “ds9-cisco” logged in 2 minutes before the script was run at Apr 20, 2025 8:11:30 AM.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
//use Logon events to determine if a user initiated the portscan
let SpecificTime = datetime(2025-04-20T13:12:29.9031119Z);
DeviceLogonEvents
| where DeviceName == "edr-machine"
| where Timestamp between ((SpecificTime - 1m) .. (SpecificTime + 1m))
| project Timestamp, ActionType, LogonType, AccountDomain, AccountName
| where ActionType == "LogonSuccess"
| sort by Timestamp desc

```

---

### 6. Search `DeviceProcessEvents`

To confirm user execution of PowerShell, I ran a query that included explorer.exe to verify an interactive login session. The results confirmed that user account "ds9-cisco" launched powershell.exe, which subsequently executed the portscan.ps1 script targeting RemoteIP "10.0.0.5".

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "edr-machine"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-04-20T13:11:00Z) .. datetime(2025-04-20T13:13:00Z))
| where FileName == "explorer.exe" or FileName == "powershell.exe"
| project Timestamp, AccountDomain, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessParentFileName, AccountName
| sort by Timestamp desc

```

---
### Response:

Immediately isolated edr-machine from the network to prevent further lateral movement or scanning. Collected forensic logs and exported relevant artifacts including portscan.ps1. Forwarded a detailed report to ds9-cisco's manager and the internal HR/security liaison. Created a case for potential policy violation and escalation.

## Chronological Event Timeline 

1. **User Login – ds9-cisco**

    **Timestamp:** 2025-04-20T13:11:30Z  
    **Event:** The user account `ds9-cisco` logged into `edr-machine` via an interactive session.  
    **Action:** Successful logon captured in `DeviceLogonEvents`.  
    **Logon Type:** Interactive (likely via RDP or local console access).

2. **Session Initialization – explorer.exe**

    **Timestamp:** 2025-04-20T13:11:36Z  
    **Event:** `explorer.exe` was launched under the `ds9-cisco` session.  
    **Action:** Confirms an interactive user session was fully initialized.  
    **Process Chain:** `winlogon.exe → userinit.exe → explorer.exe`

3. **Initial PowerShell Launch**

    **Timestamp:** 2025-04-20T13:12:10Z  
    **Event:** `powershell.exe` was launched manually during the session.  
    **Action:** No script execution yet, just interactive PowerShell access.  
    **Parent Process:** `explorer.exe`  
    **Command:** `powershell.exe`

4. **Script Execution – Portscan Script (portscan.ps1)**

    **Timestamp:** 2025-04-20T13:12:29Z  
    **Event:** The user `ds9-cisco` executed the `portscan.ps1` script.  
    **Action:** The script was downloaded via `Invoke-WebRequest` and run with bypassed execution policy.  
    **File Path:** `C:\programdata\portscan.ps1`  
    **Process Path:** `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`  
    **Command:** `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\programdata\portscan.ps1`  
    **Parent Process:** `cmd.exe`, originally launched by PowerShell.

5. **Port Scan Activity**

    **Timestamp Range:** 2025-04-20T13:12:30Z → 13:13:01Z  
    **Event:** The script initiated numerous connection attempts to internal IPs, especially targeting `10.0.0.5`.  
    **Action:** Identified as internal port scanning, likely probing for open services.  
    **Table Reference:** `DeviceNetworkEvents` confirmed failed connections originating from `edr-machine`.

## Summary

Through a timeline-based investigation, it was determined that the user account ds9-cisco logged into edr-machine and initiated a PowerShell session during an active desktop session. Shortly thereafter, a script named portscan.ps1 was executed, which triggered a wave of internal port scanning behavior targeting IPs in the 10.0.0.0/16 subnet. Logs confirmed 23 failed connections to internal devices, consistent with port scanning behavior. The parent-child process chain and timestamps support that this action was manually initiated by the logged-in user.

## Recommendations

Recommendations and Improvements
To reduce the attack surface and mitigate similar behavior in the future, the following measures are recommended:
Restrict PowerShell usage: Apply Group Policy to limit PowerShell usage to administrators or known automation accounts. Constrain Execution Policy: Set organization-wide default PowerShell Execution Policy to AllSigned or Restricted. Implement AppLocker or WDAC: Block unapproved script execution paths such as C:\programdata\ or C:\Users\Public\. Monitor for Suspicious Web Requests: Enable alerts for Invoke-WebRequest and similar tools accessing external domains. Enable Network Segmentation: Prevent unrestricted communication across all devices on the internal subnet. User Awareness Training: Educate employees about acceptable use policies and risks associated with internal scanning or scripting tools.
